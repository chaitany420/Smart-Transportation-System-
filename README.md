# Smart Transportation System 
## In this case, We will be having one shop (transportation portal) and various pickup Destinations (godowns). There will be many stations between these shop and destination. So basically various items will be loaded on the trucks/vans or we can say,  items will be weighted in different containers by the use of “BINPACKING” algorithm to get the maximum of items/material to be loaded with minimum number of vans to be used thereby making it economically smoother for the owner. 
## Also in this project we will be mainly focusing on finding the shortest distances between the shop and destinations by the use of “Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)” . By the use of this algorithm we have calculated the amount of cost, including the travel cost, fuel cost etc.  Used to transfer our items to a particular destination in every successful way possible.
Cashing or money transactions for this transportation portal will be carried out by the help of “Coin change algorithm “ , which is basically a kind of greedy algorithm only .

## •	USERS OF THE SYSTEM:
-	BUSINESSMEN
-	RETAILERS
-	TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS



## •	FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
-	Web accessible information base 

-	Provide templates for information entry – e.g. education, travel directions, public transportation feedback, etc.


-	Allow for easy update of information by city employees

-	Allow for easy retrieval of feedback collected to facilitate acting on feedback received.


-	Allow to get the info for number of vans to be used.

-	Allow to get the info for number of box that can be loaded on the van


-	Allow report of fuel consumption and rates .

-	Count of number of currency notes to be returned for balance , if there,  after the transaction.(coin change algorithm).
